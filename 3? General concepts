3? General concepts
1 - Ontology
2 - Suppliments (Shacl, Shex, Ontology extensions etc.)
3 - Modifiers, loaders, validators, inferencers. Can either apply globally (e.g. inference) or locally (e.g. validators)
[or are ^^ just handlers]

To consider - do we need to *force* users to load all supplimentary ontologies
To think about - getting all proxies to reference the same ontology triples so we aren't creating a large number of dupllicate triples
